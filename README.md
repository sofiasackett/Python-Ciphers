### Affine Cipher

The Affine Cipher program offers a practical implementation of this monoalphabetic substitution cipher. The Affine Cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. 

### Atbash Cipher

My Atbash Cipher program encodes and decodes messages by replacing each letter in the plaintext with its mirror image in the alphabet.

### Baconian Cipher

Explore my implementation of the Baconian Cipher, a binary encoding technique for representing alphabet letters, where letters are represented by combinations of 'A' and 'B'. This Python program demonstrates my ability to handle binary operations in the context of classical ciphers.

### Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher program showcases my grasp of simple substitution ciphers, with each letter shifted by a specified number of places. 

### Keyword Cipher

The Keyword Cipher program creates a substitution alphabet based on a keyword given by the user.

### Latin Alphabet Cipher

The Latin Alphabet Cipher is a straightforward substitution cipher with a reordered alphabet. 

### Morse Code

The Morse Code program exhibits my proficiency in translating text characters to and from Morse Code, a sequence of dots and dashes.

### ROT13 Cipher

The ROT13 cipher is another simple letter substition cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted 13 places.

### Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution method that utilizes a user-given keyword. 

### XOR Cipher

The XOR Cipher program showcases my expertise in bitwise operations for encryption. This project reflects my capability to work with exclusive or (XOR) logic to encode and decode messages.

### Conclusion
Feel free to explore these Python programs, which serve as both a testament to my armchair interest in cryptography and a practical demonstration of my programming skills. If you have any inquiries or opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to reach out. Thank you for checking out this repository!
